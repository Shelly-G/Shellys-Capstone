Overview
My travel expense splitting application will allow users to enter descriptions and dollar amounts for expenses that are to be divided by the users in the group. This is useful for users when multiple people are paying for various travel expenses for a group trip. For example, one person pays for the hotel stays, another person pays for the rental car, another pays for concert tickets. This app will let each group member know if they owe the other group members any money and how much. A link to PayPal or Venmo will provide an easy way for payments to be delivered to the group members. I am traveling to California with a group of friends for a summer camp / music festival in September and this app will help us keep all of the expenses organized and keep everyone up to date with what money is owed and to whom.
